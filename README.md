# Gadaz
Graphics library written in C using OpenGL and GLFW

### Features
Support for: model loading, shaders, textures, camera's & math

### Todo:
I want to keep the library as small as possible. However, there are couple of small things I still want to implement:

- [ ] Optimize model loading
- [ ] Texture loading with the model
- [ ] Basic lighting
